# Hi, I'm Thomas 👋

### ML / Computer Vision & Software Engineering (MSc TU Graz)

I build practical AI systems and full-stack apps — especially projects that involve **visual data**, **LLMs**, and **product-grade engineering** (APIs, UIs, evaluation, deployment).

- 📍 Austria (open to Austria / Switzerland / London / remote)
- 🎓 MSc Computer Science, TU Graz (GPA 1.5/5.0)
- 🔭 Interests: Computer Vision, LLM pipelines, document understanding, visual tooling

---

## What I work on
- **Applied ML & CV:** data pipelines, training/inference, evaluation, model integration
- **LLM-powered systems:** RAG, extraction, semantic segmentation, grounded generation
- **Full-stack:** FastAPI, React, databases, deployments

---

## Featured projects (soon)
- Master thesis system (LLM-based document segmentation + learning objective induction)
- Food recommender webapp (LLM preference-based recipes + image generation)
- Art gallery webapp (real-world client use + AI integration)
- Dino Demolition (custom physics / simulation project)

---

## Tools & Languages
**Daily**
- Python, TypeScript/JavaScript
- PyTorch, FastAPI
- React, Node.js
- MongoDB / Postgres
- Docker, Git

**Worked with**
- Unity (games & simulation)
- OpenAI APIs / LLM tooling
- Cloud deployments (Vercel/Render/etc.)
