# Hi, I'm Thomas 👋

### Applied AI Engineer | Computer Vision & LLM Systems

MSc Computer Science graduate (TU Graz, GPA 1.5/5.0) building production-oriented AI systems that combine machine learning, computer vision, and full-stack engineering.

I focus on turning research ideas into deployable systems — including LLM pipelines, pose estimation workflows, hybrid backend architectures, and evaluation-driven ML applications.

- 📍 Austria (open to Austria / Switzerland / London / remote)
